# Go Web Scraper

A simple web scraper written in Go using the [Colly](https://github.com/gocolly/colly) framework.  
This scraper extracts recipe information (title, ingredients, prep time, cooking time, servings, etc.) from recipe web pages like [Love and Lemons](https://www.loveandlemons.com).

## Features

- Uses CSS selectors to extract data  
- Handles HTTP requests and errors gracefully  
- Easily customizable to scrape other recipe sites by updating selectors

---

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.18+ installed on your machine  
- Internet connection for scraping live websites

## Usage

Run the scraper by providing the recipe URL as a command-line argument:

```bash
go run main.go scraper.go <recipe-url>

## Code Structure

- `main.go`: Entry point; parses command-line arguments and calls the scraper function  
- `scraper.go`: Contains the scraping logic using Colly and data models for recipes

To scrape other websites or extract additional data:

- Inspect the target site's HTML structure  
- Update CSS selectors inside `scraper.go` accordingly (in the `ScrapeRecipe` function)
